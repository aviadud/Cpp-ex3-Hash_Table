summary:
Implement of HashMap and SpamDetector.

files:
HashMap.hpp
SpamDetector.cpp
README

notes:
I didn't make [] operator to const HashMap, because if a new key is the parameter - there need to be
 a change in the HashMap.
I couldn't find a way to make const and not const at() function without copy and paste.
I personally think that if two HashMaps have the same pairs, upper and lower load factor - so there
are the same, and the capacity is not factor to differ between them.
I personally don't agree that if a key is not on HashMap so bucketSize() should throw an exception.
In my opinion it should return the size of the bucket regardless if the bucket contain the key.
